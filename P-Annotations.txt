Autowiring Injection: Spring look for matches in property by type, class or interface.
	Constructor injection(@Autowired)
			As of Spring Framework 4.3, an @Autowired annotation on such a constructor is no 
			longer necessary if the target bean only defines one constructor to begin with. 
	Setter injection
	Field injection
	
	Which one is better? : Choose a style, stay consistent in your project. All have the same function. 
	
	Qualifiers: (@Qualifiers("DEFAULT ID CLASS")) - Field injection
	With constructor: @Autowired
    				  public TennisCoach(@Qualifier("randomFortuneService") FortuneService theFortuneService) {
    				  fortuneService = theFortuneService;
    				  }
